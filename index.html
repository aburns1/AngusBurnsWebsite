                    <h3>Where do I Call Home</h3>
                    <p>
                        I grew up in British Columbia in a small town called Slocan. It is located in the West Kootenays. It is
                        equidistant between three beautiful ski hills. In the summer I enjoyed wakeboarding on Slocan Lake, and hike in the
                        surrounding mountains.

                        Since I have enrolled as a student in the faculty of engineering at Carleton University, I have lived in Ottawa and
                        it has become my new home.

                    <h3>Little Bit About School</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am a student in Computer Systems Engineering at Carleton University. I have been living in Ottawa since 2009.
                        My courses have focused on realtime microprocessor systems, digital logic devices, and analog electronics.

                        I am currently working on my fourth year project with the goal of creating a wearable electronic assistive 
                        device for visually impaired swimmers.

                    <h3>What I Enjoy in Ottawa</h3>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy cooking. Going grocery shopping is enjoyable for me. I longboard as one of my main modes of transportation.
                        It is a quick way around the city and is easy to take on the bus with me or store in the coat check of a
                        local establishment while I walk around downtown.
